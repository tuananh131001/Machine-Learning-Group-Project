    "Among the most important areas in the world is human health. Exploring the methods for preventing and detecting health problems has sparked a lot of interest. Cancer is the most common illness that has a significant impact on human health. A malignant tumor is a cancerous tumor that develops as a result of the disease. Colon cancer, together with breast cancer and lung cancer, is the third most deadly disease in the United States, killing 49,190 people in 2016 [1]. This is a cancer that begins in the large intestine colon, which is the last component of the digestive system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning technique should be used in this assignment to aid in the detection of malignant cells and the differentiation of cell types in colon cancer. Deep learning algorithms such as AlexNet, Resnet50, and VGG19 will all be developed and evaluated in this notebook, with XGBoost being the sole non-deep learning option to tackle the issue."
